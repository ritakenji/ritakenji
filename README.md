## About Me
My name is [Rita](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/72/63/01/7263011b01694e713603e6591c5c9b11.jpg) and I have been playing around with HTML and CSS since the dawn of time (early internet days I guess). I started with customizing my own blogs like lifejournal, tumblr and myspace back in the day. I have joined the Web Development bootcamp at SPICED Academy to learn and improve my skills at front-end development in hopes to facilitate a career change by the end of 2025.


### Experience 
As I stated in the previous section, I am self-taught in HTML and CSS but I also have:
- 🌱 Concluded a basic Front-End Development course in Lisbon in 2013 (HTML, CSS and Javascript);
- 📝 Learned some Back-End Development in a course that unfortunately couldn't finish;
- 🔭 Reviewed my skills a couple of times through CodeAcademy, back when it was a free platform;
- 🎨 Created a portfolio website for a friend back in 2016;
- 📚 Created a business website for another friend in 2022.

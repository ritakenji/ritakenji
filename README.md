## About Me
My name is [Rita](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/72/63/01/7263011b01694e713603e6591c5c9b11.jpg) and I have been playing around with HTML and CSS since the dawn of time (early internet days I guess). I started with customizing my own blogs like lifejournal, tumblr and myspace back in the day. I have joined the Web Development bootcamp at SPICED Academy to learn and improve my skills at front-end development in hopes to facilitate a career change by the end of 2025.


### Experience 
As I stated in the previous section, I am self-taught in HTML and CSS but I also have:
- 🌱 Concluded a basic [Front-End Development course](https://flag.pt/) in Lisbon in 2013 (HTML, CSS and Javascript);
- 📝 Learned some [Back-End Development](https://flag.pt/) in a course that unfortunately couldn't finish;
- 🔭 Reviewed my skills a couple of times through [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), back when it was a free platform;
- 🎨 Created a portfolio website for a friend back in 2016 <i>(no longer active)</i>;
- 📚 Co-created a [business website](https://www.adumatory.com) for another friend in 2022.

### What Else? 
![What Else Image](/paint.gif)

Besides all this, I am a ⭐<b>multidisciplinary artist</b>⭐. Most of it is based around crafts and visual art such as photography, fashion design and costume construction, makeup art, tattoos, cross-stitching, soldering, pottery, graphic design, pixelart, jewelry and accessories creation and so much more! 
I am also involved in a couple of cool projects, one of them is creating my own 🐛portfolio website🐛 as well as a tumblr that will work as a sort of newsletter for my very vivid ☁️dream💤 logs.

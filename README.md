## About Me
I'm Rita and I have been playing around with HTML and CSS since the dawn of time (early internet days, I guess). I started with customizing my own blogs like lifejournal, tumblr and myspace back in the day. I have recently joined the Web Development bootcamp at SPICED Academy to learn and improve my skills at front-end development in hopes to facilitate a career change by the end of 2025.


### Experience 
As I stated in the previous section, I am self-taught in HTML and CSS but I also have:
- 🌱 Concluded a [Front-End Development course](https://flag.pt/) in Lisbon in 2013 (HTML, CSS and Javascript);
- 📝 Learned some Back-End Development [here](https://flag.pt/).
- 🔭 Kepts playing around and reviewing my skills a couple of times through [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/);
- 🎨 Created a portfolio website for a friend back in 2016 <i>(no longer active)</i>;
- 📚 Co-created a [business website](https://www.adumatory.com) for another friend in 2022.

### What Else? 
![What Else Image](/paint.gif)

Besides all this, I am a ⭐<b>multidisciplinary artist</b>⭐. Most of it is based around crafts and visual art such as photography, fashion design and costume construction, makeup art, tattoos, cross-stitching, soldering, pottery, graphic design, pixelart, jewelry and accessories creation and so much more! 
I am also involved in a couple of cool projects, one of them is creating my own 🐛portfolio website🐛 as well as a tumblr that will work as a sort of newsletter for my very vivid ☁️dream💤 logs.

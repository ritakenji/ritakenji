## About Me
<p>My name is Rita, I am a front-end developer and artist.</p>
<p>As someone born in the early 90s without any siblings, the computer and the internet were my best friends. Because of that, I have been playing around with HTML and CSS since the dawn of time (since around 2005, roughly). 
I started out by customizing my own blogs like LiveJournal, Myspace and Tumblr as a fun hobby and since then I have helped friends create their own professional websites.</p>
<p>In 2025, I decided to pursue this path professionally as coding has been such a big part of my life and is something that not only brings me joy, but also challenges me and keeps my problem solving skills and creativity actively engaged.</p>

One of the most interesting web-development projects I am currently working on is creating my own 🐛<b>online art portfolio</b>🐛, as well as a 💤<b>dream blog</b>💤 to keep track of my incredibly detailed and vivid dreams, that will include a <b>newsletter feature</b> for those interested in keeping up with the most curious, random stories my brain germinates at night. 

Besides all this, I am a ⭐<b>multidisciplinary artist</b>⭐. Most of it is based around crafts and visual art such as photography, fashion design and costume construction, makeup art, tattooing, cross-stitching, soldering, pottery, graphic design, pixelart, jewelry and accessories creation, and so much more!

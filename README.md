## About Me
My name is Rita and I have been playing around with HTML and CSS since the dawn of time (early internet days I guess). I started with customizing my own blogs like lifejournal, tumblr and myspace back in the day. I have joined the Web Development bootcamp at SPICED Academy to learn and improve my skills at front-end development and in hopes to facilitate a career change by the end of 2025.
